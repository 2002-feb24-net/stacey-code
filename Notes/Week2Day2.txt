these are the general steps you should follow -
in restaurant reviews, identify the classes which hold the data which we are storing, and, locate all the places where we do serialization, deserialization, and file I/O. it's not too many places.
install the right EF Core package like Harold said - right click on "Dependencies" part of the project that needs it, and then "Manage Nuget Packages"
create a class derived from DbContext, which has DbSets for each kind of class which will be going in the database. also, give it an OnConfiguring override which provides it a connection string.
replace the deserializing code with code that uses an instance of your context class to get all this data as objects.
(harder) replace the serializing code with code that goes through what your context sees in the DB and what you have in C#, and corrects the DB to have the same data.
