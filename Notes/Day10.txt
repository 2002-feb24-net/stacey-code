Week B Day 5

Big O notation, we discussed nested loops may be to the order of O(n^2)
like in the case of bubble sort

Dictionary is in System Collections Generic namespace
insert and access with key value pairs
allways initiallize with a built-in type or user defined type
-becareful when using user-defined type because you have to know what it would meean for two objects would be equal
we talk about
-static vs. instance
-field
-methods (know array methods, etc)
-properties
(auto-implemented)
class SampleClass
{
    public int SampleProperty { get; set; }
}
(user-defined property)
class SampleClass
{
    private int _sample;
    public int Sample
    {
        // Return the value stored in a field.
        get => _sample;
        // Store the value in the field.
        set =>  _sample = value;
    }
}

-jagged arrays
-bubble sort
--fibonacci
-var
-basics of value types (variable contains a value in a certain memory location) vs. reference type (value are maintained regardless of sending over a method)
separation of concern should be considered when constructing the considered
we can store data in different type of Collections
what tool would you use in certain situations
describe bubble sort and merge sort (*in English)
use recursion as one way to break down a problem into smaller sub problems
-a method calling itself
-interative on the other hand is handle by the for and while, foreach, 
-foreach for a collection that doesn't have order and also if the index is not used with in the interative process
Debugger - when do you use, what is it good for, step out, step in, 

P0 - store application
non-technical requirements
menu interface
(using the console application)
classes: customer, product, order, store locations due in the middle of week 3, March 25th
