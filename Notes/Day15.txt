Async

A way to do multiple task run about the same time, taking turns for fulfillment
The Task abstraction allows us to process serialization and other methods through async means.

Use keyword async in method signature and in the name. Additionally, there should be an await keyword used in the other Read serialization statements

example

static async Task Main(string[] args){}

serverside of a web app, multi-users service requests

Interfaces are the best example of Abstraction, as well as properties and other methods that are predefined in the language.

Encapsulation is a way of bundling data and behavior into one unit. A project with 10 class may have some that don't involve objects directly and therefore, causing most of the implementation to be "hidden."

structs, delegates and enums cannot be overriden, but may appear in Inherited members or classes.

example of polymorphism in properties:

double _perimeter;

double Perimeter
{
	get=> _perimeter;
	set=> _perimeter = value;
}


Five design principles S.O.L.I.D.

Single purpose
Open-Close principle open for extension but closed for modification (without having to modify code for each scenario)
Liskov Substitution - derived class should be autonomous of its parent (base class)
Interface segragation only relateable components should be shared within a class
Dependency Inversion is a way of building loosely coupled applications, while making considerations for separation of concerns

Strategies for testing

break down into parts and testing each one itself. two types: unit testing (debugger) which is class by class, and integration testing (use case) where more than one class is involved.

xUnit, NUnit are third party testing implementation libraries
MS uses MSTest
dependency injection is where you are requiring certain code by signature of the code (as a parameter)
