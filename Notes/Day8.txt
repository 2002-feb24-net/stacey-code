Week B Day 3

offer day - signed promissary note 36,500

List  are generic, ordered, allowed to have duplicates, and can change
Hash Set are generic, unordered, does not allow duplicates and can change size.
Both are in the System.Collections.Generic namespace, and Count method in common

can check contents with Contains
populate with the Add dmethod
depopulate with Remove method
any substring can be added like in a UnionWith method to include more of the same tipe data
 for each is how you would iterate through
 based on array

 use hash set for first duplicate question in codesignal
 need a hash function with useful properties take what is inside the set 
 advantage of being unordered ( insert is fast and able the search or check membership)
 hash function makes the efficiency speed up to O(1) instead of O(n) that is true for list/arrays

 search the array and add to a list, but see if it contains the value
 if no duplicates found return -1 after the loop

 initialize list:
 List<int> seen = new List<int>();

 initialize hash set:
 HashSet<int> seen = new HashSet<int>();

 search for the hashcode on the int Set
 seen.nt32.GetHashCode

 check the slack for set image, do a git pull for updates

 binanry search is O(log(n))


 Multi array  can be jagged in the sense that the inner dmensions do not have to be the same length


Matrices - 
make a class that can represent a matrix
