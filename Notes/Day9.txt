Review of Bubble Sort
-do while loop used
Debugging code
-config .json file to run the debugger on code that has an read or readline input request.
-you can follow the stack trace. Alt+Click on the location of the error to jum to the place where the derror existed in the code
- error closest to the problem is typically on top of the stack trace.
-break pooints and stepping line by line are most useful in the debugger.
-break point is like a pause in execution of the 
-continue is going to allow debugger to keep going with the code 
-restart lets you begin again
-step out lets you jump up one method higher
-step into lets you follow a method in its execution

check a program with method and multiple loops 
*put break points and watch variables change as you perform stepping.

Merge Sort
//uses a recursive algorithm

fibonacci is the sum of the prevoius 2 elements

recursion requires base case, and recursive case (break down and repeat; recalling method)
