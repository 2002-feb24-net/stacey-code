git has been around for a long time and its main job is version control (VCS), or source control management (SCM) tool

to get started (workflow):
$ git clone https://github.com/yourFolder/PATH
$ cd /~PATH
$ git pull

whe you call clone then you are getting a copy of the repository by its URL 

1. make changes to the repo ( an absolutely new repository would require the command - git init)
2. record those changes in the git, locally(git add <PATH>, git commit -m "description of changes"
3. git push, updat eht recorded changes to a remote github
 you can 1.  copy out any file you don't want to lose 2. delete repo and 3. clone
git status 
git origin 

make a repo
