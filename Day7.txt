Week B Day 2

Classes/Objects
-a place where data and logic/behavior get grouped together
-fields are like variables. they exist in a class and are accessible to methods within that class
-static assigns a method or class to a program and do not require an instance
-access modifiers like public and private are keywords for the methods and classids
-public allows the program to "see" the implementation of the method or class
-override allows the method to gain its own implementation that is uniquely specific from the parent class (Objects)
-name of the class should be the same as the file name.
